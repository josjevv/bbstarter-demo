## A demo app for [bbstarter](http://github.com/madhums/bbstarter)

The application demonstrates simple CRUD operations on items. The items are
fetched from nodejs-express server which returns the results from mongodb
in json format. A more or less REST based implementation.

To start the app

```sh
npm install
node web.js
```
Then visit `http://localhost:3000`
